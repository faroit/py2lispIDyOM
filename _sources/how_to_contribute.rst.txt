You can contribute by reporting an issue or by directly contributing to the source code.


1. It is generally better to start with an issue report on Github to describe any issue or suggestion you intend to fix or add.

2. Follow the normal process of forking the project, setting up a new branch to work in, and making changes, as outlined in this
`Github guideline <https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects>`_.
